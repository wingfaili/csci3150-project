# Warmup Exercise 2

This warmup exercise is to let students experience strange bugs. There are four questions:

1. The first question is about "*how should we measure the size of an array*".
2. The second question is about "*how should be measure the size of a structure*".
3. The third question is a revision on the usage of `execve()` system call family. Also, you will find how one can smartly using the first argument, in the code `person.c`.
4. The fourth question is about the careful use of parentheses.
